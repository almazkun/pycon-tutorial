# Django Jeonse Calculator
Source code for Pycon Korea 2023 Tutorial

## Aim of this project
In this comprehensive tutorial, we will explore how to build a modern, feature-rich rental listing website using Django, a popular Python web framework, and several community packages. By harnessing the power of packages such as django-allauth, django-tables2, django-htmx, and django-filter, we will create a dynamic and efficient website that offers enhanced functionality and user experience.

Throughout the tutorial, we will guide you through the process of setting up the Django project and integrating these community packages seamlessly. We will demonstrate how django-allauth simplifies user authentication, registration, allowing users to easily sign up, log in, and manage their rental listings.

We will leverage the power of django-tables2 to generate interactive and customizable tables for displaying rental listings, complete with sorting, pagination, and filtering capabilities. By integrating django-htmx, we will implement seamless and efficient user interactions, such as updating listing details, filtering results, and dynamically loading content without full page refreshes, resulting in a smooth and responsive user interface.

To enhance the search functionality, we will utilize django-filter to create advanced filtering options, enabling users to refine their search results based on criteria such as location, price range, amenities, and more.

Throughout the tutorial, we will provide clear and concise instructions, accompanied by code examples and demonstrations of each package's usage. By the end of the tutorial, you will have a fully functional rental listing website that showcases the power of Django and its community packages in creating modern, fast, and feature-rich web applications.
